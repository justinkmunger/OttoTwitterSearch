OttoTwitterSearch
=================

Otto is an event-bus framework that gives a unified approach for communication between
components in Android using strongly-typed messages. This application demonstrates the
core features of the framework with basic Twitter search functionality.

This application demonstrates the Otto open-source framework from Square and is the basis 
of sample code used in the Otto presentation given at GDG Schaumburg on January 9, 2013.
It is used to contrast against traditional component communication techniques as
demonstrated in the RegularTwitterSearch project, found at:
